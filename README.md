# Radboud University assignments

In this repo you can find Radboud University (Erasmus period) assignment papers and some course descriptions

## Course list
2023 spring/summer (my 2nd bachelor year of Software Engineering)

1. Electromagnetism 6 ECTS

Course based on Introduction To Electrodynamics by D. J. Griffiths
(running through vector analysis, excluding relativity)

THIS COURSE WAS ABSOLUTE FIRE! They say it's the hardest course for physicists in Radboud University with half of the students failing the first exam attempt. It's also kindof a continuation of another course with more basics of electricity. But if you know basics, this course really builds the overall understanding of electromagnetism and theoretical physics in general together with some of the most common differential equation solving techniques.

But the most importantly - THE LECTURER WAS SO GOOD! It almost always felt like you understand everything, everything is clear and SUPER INTERESTING, everything is continuous, building the overall whole understanding of EVERYTHING. And the seminar teachers were also SO GOOD! They explained all the complex concepts in simple terms through the given problem sets.
